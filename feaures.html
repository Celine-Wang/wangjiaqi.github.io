<h3>Concordancer       Tool   </h3>
<br/> 
The  Concordancer  Tool  has  a  wide  range  of  features  that  make  it  an  extremely  effective  tool  not  only for learners, but also teachers and researchers. These are summarized as follows: 
<p/>
<p>
1.  Search  terms  can  be  substrings,  words,  or  phrases,  and  can  be  case  sensitive  or  insensitive.  They  can  be  embedded  with  a  wide  range  of  wildcards,  which  the  user  can  assign  to  any  particular character or string of characters via a menu option. 
<p/> 
<p>
2.  Search  terms  can  be  defined  as  full  regular  expressions  (REGEX),  offering  the  user  access  to  extremely powerful and complex searches. 
<p/> 
<p>
3. Three levels of sorting of KWIC (Key Word In Context) lines are possible, with user definable highlight colors at each level. 
<p/> 
<p>
4. If a user clicks on any search term in the KWIC results display, the program will automatically open the View Files tool (described later) and show the search term hit in the original data file.
<p/> 
<p>
5. The  KWIC  results  display  is  divided  into  columns,  in  which  the  hit  number,  KWIC  line,  and  file  name  are  shown  separately.  As  in  all  other  tools,  each  column  can  be  either  displayed  or  hidden,  and  standard  selection  methods  can  be  used  to  save  data  in  the  columns  or  rows  to  the  clipboard or a text file.

<h3> Concordance PlotTool   </h3>
<br/> 
This tool shows concordance search  results  plotted ina  'barcode' format, with the length of the text normalized to the width of the bar and each hit shown as a vertical linewithin the bar. This allows you to see the position where search results appear in target texts.The tool also allows youto see which files include the target search term, and can  also  be  used  to  identify  where  the  search  term  hits  cluster together.  An  example  of  the  use  of  the Plot  Toolis  in  determining where  specific  content  words  appear  in  a  technical  paper,  or whereanactor  or  story  characterappears  during  the  course  of  a play  or novel.
</p>
<p>
The number of hits and length of each text is shown to the right of the barcode plot, and the plot itself can be enlarged or reduced in size using the“PlotZoom”buttons.
</p>
<p>
If you move the cursor over the highlighted search term in one of the concordance lines, the cursor will change to  a  small  hand  icon.  Clicking  on  the  highlighted  search  term  willallow youto  view  the  search  term  hit  as  it appears in the original file viathe File View Tool(see below). 
</p>
<p>
Search  terms  can  be  specified  as  being  "words"(default)  or  "character  strings",  and  searches  can  be“case insensitive” (default), “case sensitive,”or "Regex" based. Advanced searches are also available. For detailssee the Concordance Tool explanation.

2) If a search term has been specified, the search term hits will be highlighted  throughout  the  text.  Search  options  are  the  same as for the ConcordanceTooland Concordance PlotTool.
<br/>
3) Use the "Hit Location" buttons to jump to the appropriate hit in the file.
<br/>
4) Change the search term and click on the 'Start' button to view other hits in the file.
<br/>
5) Click on the highlighted text togenerate a set of KWIC lines using the highlighted text as the search term.
<br/>
6) Click on the “Clone Results”button to create a copy of the results so that different sets of results can be compared.
</p>
<p>
Search  terms  can  be  specified  as  being  "words"(default)  or  "character  strings",  and  searches  can  be“case insensitive”(default), “case sensitive,”or "Regex" based. Advanced searches are also available. For detailssee the Concordance Tool explanation.
